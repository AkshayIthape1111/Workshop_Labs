# Filesystem Hierarchy For Linux
All files on a linux system are stored on file systems which are organized into a single inverted tree of directories, known as a **file system hierarchy**.This tree is inverted because the root of the tree is said to be at the top of the hieratchy, and the branches of directories and subdirectories stretch below the root.
